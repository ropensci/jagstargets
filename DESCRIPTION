Package: jagstargets
Title: Targets for JAGS Workflows
Description: Bayesian data analysis usually incurs long runtimes
  and cumbersome custom code.
  A pipeline toolkit tailored to Bayesian statisticians,
  the 'jagstargets' R package is leverages
  'targets' and 'R2jags' to ease this burden.
  'jagstargets' makes it super easy to set up scalable
  JAGS pipelines that automatically parallelize the computation
  and skip expensive steps when the results are already up to date.
  Minimal custom code is required, and there is no need to manually
  configure branching, so usage is much easier than 'targets' alone.
  For the underlying methodology, please refer
  to the documentation of 'targets' <doi:10.21105/joss.02959> and 'JAGS'
